<h1>Notes for Lesson Zero</h1>


<p>Daaaaamn. I should haveepaid more attention to where to get codepen.</p> 

<p>Quizzes don't work on the iphone 5s. That's <b>not <em>exceptionally</em> convenient</b>. In fact, it's <img src="https://flamingbagofpoo.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/inconceivable.jpg" </p>

<p>Otherwise, very excited about this. Like the lessons so far. Very cool to learn from people who are learning. And from people who are double nutcrazy pro.<p> 

<p>Easy peasy so far. HTML tags and elements and everything is just review of <a href="http://www.codecademy.com">codecademy</a> stuff... although of none of that ever became muscle memory and this is the perfect way to get reminded of it. All of a sudden I'm all excited about this stuff again.</p> 

<br>Anyway... <br>

<h1>My Goal</h1>
<h3>I will build my simple racetrack data app and trade it to grassroots motorsport for a free tshirt... or maybe to Edge Motorworks to make up for punching holes in the Mini's bumper.</h3>

<p>Luckily, they've taken notes for me, and they're decent notes. So... here are those:</p>

<b>How the Web Works</b>
<p>The web is a bunch of computers that communicate with each other. When a person goes to a web page like www.google.com, their computer sends
  a <em>HTTP Request</em> to a <em>server</em>. The
  server finds the appropriate HTML document and sends
  it back to the user's computer where a <em>web browser</em>
  interprets the page and displays it on the user's screen.

  does a good job of explaining.
</p>

<b>HTML</b>
<p>HTML stands for <em>Hypertext Markup Language.</em> HTML documents form the majority of the
  content on the web. HTML documents contain <em>text content</em> which describes "what you see"
  and <em>markup</em> which describes "how it looks".
  <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud721/l-3508959201/m-48724340"> This
  video</a> gives a good overview.
</p>

<b>Tags and Elements</b>
<p>HTML documents are made of HTML <b>elements</b>. When
  writing HTML, we tell browsers the type of each element by using HTML <b>tags</b>.
  <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud721/l-3508959201/m-48723444">This video</a>
  explains the distinction well.
</p>

<b>Why Computers are Stupid</b>
<p>Computers are stupid because they interpret instructions
  literally. This makes them very unforgiving since a
  small mistake by a programmer can cause huge problems
  in a program.
</p>

<b>Inline vs Block Elements</b>
<p>HTML elements are either <b>inline</b> or <b>block</b>. Block
  elements form an "invisible box" around the content inside of
  them.
